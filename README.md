# Hello there, Welcome to my profile!! :sunglasses:

I'm Jared Martinez, I'm a self-taught developer. I started studying on my own, even though it is a difficult path, I have found people willing to help and teach. While I don't have any professional experience in these fields yet, I have been honing my skills through personal projects.

During this time of learning I got these technical skills:

- Salesforce App Builder Certification 
- HTML
- CSS
- JavasScript
- SQL
- C#

I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge. If you're looking for a dedicated and passionate web developer with skills in Salesforce, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm excited to learn and work together.
